# Welcome to your CDK Java Gradle project!

You should explore the contents of this project.
It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkJavaGradleStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It's a [Gradle](https://gradle.org)-based project,
so you can open this project with any Gradle-compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

## Useful commands

* `npm install`     - install the CDK CLI package locally
* `./gradlew build` - compile and run tests
* `npx cdk ls`      - list all stacks in the app
* `npx cdk synth`   - show the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `npx cdk deploy`  - deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `npx cdk diff`    - compare deployed stack with current state
* `npx cdk docs`    - open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
