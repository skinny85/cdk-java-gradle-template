# Welcome to your CDK Java Gradle project!

You should explore the contents of this project.
It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkJavaGradleStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It's a [Gradle](https://gradle.org)-based project,
so you can open this project with any Gradle-compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

## Useful commands

 * `./gradlew build` - compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`          - list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       - emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      - deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        - compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        - open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
